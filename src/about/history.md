## History of Guatemala

The history of Guatemala begins with the Maya civilization, which flourished in the region from 2600 BC to 1697 AD. The Spanish conquest of Guatemala in 1524 brought an end to the Maya era, and the country became a colony of Spain.

Guatemala gained independence from Spain in 1821, and it was briefly part of the United Provinces of Central America. However, the union was short-lived, and Guatemala became an independent republic in 1847.

The 20th century was a turbulent time for Guatemala. The country experienced a series of civil wars, and there was a long period of military rule. In 1996, Guatemala finally signed a peace agreement, and the country has been slowly recovering since then.

Today, Guatemala is a vibrant and diverse country with a rich history. The Maya culture still plays an important role in Guatemalan society, and the country is home to a wide variety of other cultures as well.
